title: Professional Roadmap

Greetings,  
As a System Administrator with 30+ years in Information Technology, I have enjoyed a diverse and well-rounded career in which I am constantly seeking new skills and new technologies to understand.  
       
I was recruited to Dobson Fiber by a former colleague at the College to resolve issues within their Geo-spatial Enterprise. I liaised between Dobson’s GIS department, separate IT department, Outside Plant engineers, and their GIS software vendor (ESRI).  Within my first six months, the Enterprise servers were tuned for efficiency and to better handle the newly evolving workflows.  I managed to also eliminate most of the lingering client-side ArcGIS issues when the company changed direction, eliminating my position.  
While with the Center for Spatial Analysis, within the College of Atmospheric and Geographic Sciences, I arrived almost a year after the departure of my predecessor to discover that maintenance and upkeep were skeletal, at best, and no upgrades or updates had been performed in well over a year.  I upgraded aging servers and systems to meet or exceed University policies on network security and privacy. I modified custom projects like the OTC Streamlined Sales Tax Rate Locator, to run on modern server OS’s. I upgraded and restructured obsolete technology to carry the Center forward well past the 2020 US Census, where we aggregated the Census data for the State of Oklahoma.  I replaced and designed a bespoke edge firewall solution to resolve the Center’s unique routing issues.  I designed and deployed a new Geo-spatial private cloud stack to house new research projects.   In March of 2020, working in tight coordination with the other System Administrators within the College of A&GS, and in record time, we made Data Center updates, upgrades and changes to facilitate our staff and other University employees’ ability to telecommute when the COVID pandemic sent us all into hiding.  As the Center had already been designed around the, “work from anywhere,” mindset, we became the template that other units on campus began to replicate.  
       
While with Oklahoma PC Health, Inc., I worked with Oklahoma’s expanding businesses, designing or refining their technology infrastructure; and migrating them from third-party, tech-bench computer services to a bespoke internal IT department.  I managed and executed technology projects, both great and small, ranging from migrating existing domain networks to the latest servers to preparing a company to process credit card payments.  I spear-headed projects to upgrade aging telecommunications systems.  I implemented disaster recovery plans, designed and built domain networks from the ground up—including staging the hardware.  
     
Notable experiences from other former employment include:  
    • Researched and implemented a new help-desk system for Oklahoma County.  
    • Rewrote automated procedures for the transcription of medical data for Orthopedic Institute.  
    • Joined a financially failed RadioShack Service Center slated for closure, making it profitable in less than a year with a staff of two.  
       
I enjoy the diversity in both the scope of projects and problems to solve, as well as the organizations, colleagues, and clientele with whom I work.  I look forward to flexing and expanding my current skill set; as well as helping streamline productivity by making better use of technology.  
     
As you’ve read this far I will also say, I’m a third generation Technomancer, thanks to my father and my maternal grandfather.  I’m enamored by all manner of tech, new and old.  I’m also an avid gamer—both video and tabletop, often running a loud-mouthed dwarf until his beard falls off.  Though, admittedly, I’ve had little time for gaming, of late.  Above all of that, I’m a doting husband, proud dad, prouder grandpa, ethical pirate, and philosopher.  At the end of the day, I’m just looking to level up my skills and employ them to strike a better balance between work and personal pursuits.  
     
I look forward to helping streamline your technology workflows to better suit your production needs.  
     
Simply,
