<p>Dear reader,
 Kirk is an extremely driven, knowledgeable, and proactive team player whose goals
are always focused on ensuring the best performance and experience for stakeholders.
During Kirk’s tenure as one of my employees, he proved time and time again to be a
practical and innovative thinker who could dissect a problem and provide pathways to
success. Kirk was initially brought onto my team to act as a departmental IT resource that
could also act as a liaison for our needs and the greater IT department at the company. He
was well versed in the vernacular and had personal experience in such roles, so he was a
natural fit given our present issues at the time.
 Kirk succeeded in fulfilling this supporting role within the team, actively looking for
ways to improve user experiences through tackling performance issues to taking initiative
to develop new skills to assist in the automation of tasks to make the department overall
more eƯicient. Kirk is extremely thorough in his documentation and ensures that team
members can find information they need easily. Kirk is someone who likes to roll up his
sleeves. He works best when he can get into the weeds of a problem.
Perhaps one of the most telling qualities of Kirk is his dedication. During my time
working with Kirk, it was easy to see that he cared not only about the department, but those
that operated within the system. This dedication to customer service showed that Kirk was
thoughtful about downstream eƯects of changes and decisions we made. When a solution
to a problem was presented, Kirk made sure to show how the process would play out
through its lifecycle, painting a clear picture of the planned future. This also showed that
Kirk was thinking long term.
I greatly value Kirk’s attitude and skillset. He was a great team player who was
respected amongst the team. Kirk is a hard-working and dedicated employee who will
show you that he not only can deliver practical results, but also that he is invested in the
success of his projects and all that is impacted. I would jump at the opportunity to work
with Kirk again should it arise.</p>
<p>Best,
 Blake Taylor </p>
